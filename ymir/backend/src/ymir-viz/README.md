To contribute to the framework
- Contribute to definition of API:
  - Edit `./doc/ymir_viz_API.yaml`
  - run `sh codegen.sh` to generate code
- Do not edit the folder of `./src/model` and `./src/swagger`，because it is generated by `swagger-codegen`

To run server local you can use the following command:
```
python wsgi.py
```
Then you can see the API definition by Swagger in browser:
```shell script
http://localhost:9099/v1/ui/
```
