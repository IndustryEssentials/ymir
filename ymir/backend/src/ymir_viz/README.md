To contribute to the framework

- Contribute to definition of API:
  - Edit `./doc/ymir_viz_API.yaml`
  - run `sh codegen.sh` to generate code
- Do not edit `./src/swagger_models` and `./src/swagger`ï¼Œwhich are generated by `swagger-codegen`

Run local server with the following command:

```bash
python wsgi.py
```

Then you can see the API definition by Swagger in browser:

```
http://localhost:9099/v1/ui/
```
