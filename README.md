# 1. Introduction to AI SUITE-YMIR

As a streamlined model development product, YMIR(You Mine In Recursion) focuses on the dataset versioning and model iteration in the AI SUITE open-source series.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir-images/blob/main/doc_images/processing.png" width="1500"/>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;</div>

AI commercialization is currently reaching a stage of maturity in terms of computing hardwares,  algorithms, etc. The adoption of AI often encounter challenges such as a lack of skilled developers, high development costs and long iteration cycles.

As a platform, YMIR provides an end-to-end AI development system. This platform reduces costs for companies using artificial intelligence and accelerates the adoption of artificial intelligence. YMIR provides ML developers with one-stop services for data processing, model training, and other steps required in the AI development cycle.

The YMIR platform provides effective model development capabilities with a data-centric approach. The platform integrates concepts such as active learning methods, data and model version control, and workspace. Parallel rapid iteration of data sets and projects for multiple specific tasks are realized by YMIR. The platform uses an open API design, so third-party tools can also be integrated into the system.

## 1.1. Main functions

A typical model development process can usually be summarized in a few steps: defining the task, preparing the data, training the model, evaluating the model, and deploying the model.

*  Define the target: Before starting an AI development project, it is important to be clear about what is to be analyzed. This will help developers correctly convert the problem into several typical ML modeling tasks, such as image classification, object detection, etc. Different tasks have different data requirements.

*  Prepare data: Data preparation is the foundation of a successful AI project. The most important task in this step is to ensure the quality of data and its annotations. Collect all the required data at the beginning is the optimal situation for many projects. Therefore, the project developer may find that some data is missing in subsequent stages. Additional data could be necessary upon the project  needs.

*  Train model: This operation is commonly referred to "modeling". This step refers to the exploration and analysis of prepared data to discover the internal patterns and any links between the input and the expected prediction target.  The result of this step is usually one or more machine learning models. These models can be applied to new data to obtain predictions. Developers train their own models using mainstream model training frameworks, such as pytorch, tensorflow, darknet, etc.

*  Evaluate model: The entire development process has not yet been completed after training the model. Models need to be evaluated and checked before being put into production. Normally, get a production-quality model all at once is not so easy. You need to adjust parameters, and iterate the model continuously. Some common metrics can help you evaluate models quantitatively and pick a satisfactory model. Some common metrics can help you to evaluate models quantitatively.

*  Deploy model: Models are developed and trained based on previously available data (possibly test data). After a satisfactory model is obtained, it will be applied to real data to make predictions at scale.

YMIR platform mainly meets the needs of users to produce models at scale, provides users with a good and easy-to-use display interface, and facilitates the management and viewing of data and models.

```

3. Hardware Suggestions

* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti or higher is recommended.

* The maximum CUDA version supported by the host >= 11.2

## 2.2. Installation of YMIR-GUI

The user must ensure that all the conditions in [Cuda environment dependencies](#21-cuda-environment-dependencies) have been met, otherwise the installation may fail.

The YMIR-GUI project package is on DockerHub and the steps to install and deploy YMIR are as follows:

1.  Clone the deployment project YMIR to the local server:

  ```sh
git clone https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir.git
  ```

2. If there is no available GPU and you need to install CPU mode, please change it to CPU boot mode by modifying the .env file to change the SERVER_RUNTIME parameter to runc:

`# nvidia for gpu, runc for cpu.`

`SERVER_RUNTIME=runc`

3. If you do not need to use the **label free** labeling platform, you can directly execute the start command with the default configuration: ``bash ymir.sh start``.It is recommended not to use the ``sudo`` command, otherwise it may cause insufficient privileges.

* When the service starts, it asks the user if they want to send usage reports to the YMIR development team, the default is yes if you do not enter it.
* If the user needs to use the **label free** labeling platform, you need to change the ip and port information in the .env configuration file to the address and port number of the labeling tool currently deployed by the user.

```
# Note format: LABEL_TOOL_HOST_IP=http(s)://(ip)
LABEL_TOOL_HOST_IP=set_your_label_tool_HOST_IP
LABEL_TOOL_HOST_PORT=set_your_label_tool_HOST_PORT

```

* The default port number for YMIR's Model Deployment module is 18801. If there is a conflict that needs to be modified, you need to go to the YMIR directory and modify the .env file to configure the ModelDeployment port and MySQL access password:

```
DEPLOY_MODULE_HOST_PORT=18801
DEPLOY_MODULE_URL=${DEPLOY_MODULE_HOST_PORT}
DEPLOY_MODULE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=deploy_db_passwd
```

Execute the start command after the modification: `bash ymir.sh start`.

4. After the service successfully started, YMIR will be available at [http://localhost:12001/](http://localhost:12001/). If you need to **stop the service**, run the command: `bash ymir.sh stop`

5. The default initial user is super administrator, you can check account and password through the .env file under the project path and modify it before deployment. It is recommended to change the password through the user management interface after the service deployment is completed.

  <img src="https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir-images/blob/main/doc_images/first_admin.png" width="600"/>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>

## 2.3. Installation of **Label Studio** (optional)

**Label Sudio** is also an external labeling system supported by YMIR and can be installed as an alternative labeling tool.

1. In the YMIR directory, modification Env file, configure label studio portÔºö

```
LABEL_TOOL=label_studio
# Note format: LABEL_TOOL_HOST_IP=http(s)://(ip)
LABEL_TOOL_HOST_IP=set_your_label_tool_HOST_IP
LABEL_TOOL_HOST_PORT=set_your_label_tool_HOST_PORT
```

2. After configuring the label tool (LABEL_TOOL), IP (LABEL_TOOL_HOST_IP), and port (LABEL_TOOL_HOST_PORT) start the installation of label studio command:

  ```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.label_studio.yml up -d
  ```

It is recommended not to use the ```sudo``` command, as it may result in insufficient privileges.

3. Check the status of label studio:

  ```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.label_studio.yml ps
  ```

The user can access label studio through the default URL [http://localhost:12007/](http://localhost:12007/). The installation is successful if the login page shows up.

4. Configure the **Label Studio** authorization token

¬† After the user registers and log in to Label Studio, select "Account & Settings" in the upper right corner of the page. Then, copy the token value and paste it into the corresponding location (LABEL_STUDIO_TOKEN) in the .env configuration file of the YMIR project. An example is as follows:

  ```sh
  label studio env

  LABEL_TOOL_URL=http://(ip):(LABEL_TOOL_PORT)

  LABEL_TOOL_PORT=set_your_label_tool_port

  LABEL_TOOL_TOKEN="Token token_value"

  LABEL_TASK_LOOP_SECONDS=60
  ```

  Restart ymir after configuring the token (LABEL_STUDIO_TOKEN).

5. The command to stop the label studio service is:

  ```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.label_studio.yml down
  ```

# 3. Use YMIR-GUI: typical model production process

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir-images/blob/main/doc_images/YMIR-GUI-process.jpeg" width="800"/>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;</div>

As shown in the figure, YMIR divides the model development process into multiple steps. Details about how to run each step are listed in the subsequent sections.

Data and labels are necessary for the training of deep learning, and the training requires a large amount of data with labels. However, what exists in reality is a large amount of unlabeled data, which is too costly in terms of labor and time if all of them are manually labeled.

Therefore, YMIR platform, through active learning, first attains an initial model by local import or a small amount of labeled data, and uses this initial model to mine the most beneficial data for model capability improvement from a large amount of data. After the mining is completed, only this part of the data is labeled and the original training dataset is expanded efficiently.

The updated dataset is used to train the model again to improve the model capability. The YMIR platform provides a more efficient approach than labeling the entire data and then training it, reducing the cost of labeling low-quality data. Through the cycle of mining, labeling, and training, high quality data is expanded and the model capability is improved.

This section uses a complete model iteration process as an example to illustrate how to use the YMIR platform. Please check [Operating Instructions](https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir/wiki/Operating-Instructions).

# 4. For advanced users: YMIR-CMD (command line) user's guide

This chapter contains the instructions for the YMIR-CMD. If you need to use the GUI, please refer to [Ymir-GUI Installation](#2-installation).

## 4.1 Installation

**Mode I. Pip Installation**

```
# Requires >= Python3.8.10
$ pip install ymir-cmd
$ mir --vesion
```

**Mode II. Installation from the source**

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir.git
$ cd ymir/ymir/command
$ python setup.py clean --all install
$ mir --version
```

## 4.2 Typical model production process

![process-en](https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir-images/blob/main/doc_images/process-en.jpeg)

The above figure shows a typical process of model training: 1) the user prepares external data, 2) imports it into the system, 3) appropriately filters the data, and 4) begins training to obtain a model (possibly with low accuracy). 5) selects images in a dataset to be mined that are suitable for further training based on this model,¬†6) annotates these images, 7) merges the annotated results with the original training set, and 8) uses the merged results to run the training process again to obtain a better model. This section implement the process shown above using the command line. For details, please check the [CMD usage instructions](https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir/wiki/CMD-usage-instructions).

# 5. Get the code

## 5.1. Code contribution

Any code in the YMIR repo should follow the coding standards and will be checked in the CI tests.

- Functional code needs to be unit tested.

- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) or [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to format the code before committing. Both of these follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) and [Google Python Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) style guides.

- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) - Python must go through static type checking.

Also check out [MSFT Encoding Style](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders/wiki/Coding-Guidelines) for more advice.

## 5.2. About training, inference and mining docker images

[Check this document](https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir/blob/dev/dev_docs/ymir-cmd-container.md) for details.

# 6. Design concept

We use the concept of code version control in Git to manage our data and models, use the concept of branches to create new projects so that different tasks on the same set of images can run in parallel. The additions, retrievals, updates, and deletions of datasets and basic operations are created by commits to branches. Logically, each commit stores an updated version of the dataset or new model, as well as the metadata of the operation that led to this change. Finally, only the data changes are merged into the main branch. This branch conceptually aggregates all the data annotated by many projects on the platform. Please see [Life of a dataset](https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir/wiki/Life-of-a-dataset) for specific design concepts.

# 7. MISC

## 7.1. FAQ

**Why did the upload of the local dataset fail?**

Regardless of whether the dataset has a label file, the images folder and annotations folder must be created. The images are placed in the images folder and the format is limited to jpg, jpeg, and png. The annotation files are placed in the annotations folder and the format is the pascal (when there is no annotation file, the folder is empty). Please put the images and annotations in the same folder and compress them into a ".zip" compressed package (not a .rar compressed format).

**How should I obtain training and mining configuration files?**

The default profile template needs to be extracted in the mirror.

The training image `industryessentials/executor-det-yolov4-training:release-0.1.2` has a configuration file template located at: `/img-man/training-template.yaml`

Mining and inference mirrors The configuration file templates for `industryessentials/executor-det-yolov4-mining:release-0.1.2` are located at: `/img-man/mining-template.yaml` (mining) and `/img-man/infer-template. yaml` (infer).

**How can the trained model be used outside the system?**

After successful training, the system will output the ID of the model. The user can find the corresponding file according to this id at `--model-location`. In fact, it is a tar file that can be extracted directly using the tar command to get the "mxnet" model file in parameters and JSON format.

**How to solve the deployment, debugging and operation problems encountered in windows system?**

It has not been fully tested on Windows server, so we cannot provide service support for the time being.

**How to import models I've already trained?**

See [this document](https://github.com/IndustryEssentials/ymir/blob/dev/dev_docs/import-extra-models.md).
